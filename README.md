# ❓ What is this repo?

This repo contains an http server made only in C! It took me nearly a day to figure out how web requests really work under the hood.

# Why???

Why not? :)

# 🛠️ Running the server

1. clone the repository
2. compile the c file
3. (optional) change the static files

```bash
git clone https://github.com/paolo-05/http-server-in-c
cd http-server-in-c
gcc main.c -o main
./main
```
This code is potentialy harmful and should NOT be used in any kind of enviroment different than the learning one.
